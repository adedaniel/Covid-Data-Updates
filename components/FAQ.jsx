                (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most

                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry
                cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion,
                runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t
                develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those
                with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
                problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
                medical attention.

                The risk of catching COVID-19 from the faeces of an infected person

                is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing
                research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share
                new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another
                reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and
                before eating.

                masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural

                The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in
                most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low.
                However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas)
                where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating
                with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or
                spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and
                transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other
                countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s
                important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to
                go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation
                worldwide. You can see these at

                Should I wear a mask to protect myself from catching the COVID-19
                virus? Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have
                COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are
                not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a
                mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people
                to use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to
                avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of
                masks . The most effective ways to protect yourself and others
                against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your
                cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of
                at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
                sneezing.

                We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are
                unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover. However,
                because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood, it
                is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be
                observed for patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

                Yes. Currently, five laboratories in Nigeria can diagnose

                of Lagos University Teaching Hospital; Irrua Specialist Teaching
                Hospital; Nigerian Institute of Medical Research; and African
                Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases. They are
                all in the NCDC molecular laboratory network. Health officials are
                advised to call 07032864444 for sample transportation and related
                advice if they have a case that fits the national case definition.
